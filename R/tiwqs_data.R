#' Measurement of 38 nutrients (NHANES dataset)
#'
#' We created the `tiwqs_data` dataset to show how apply the two-indices WQS (2iWQS).
#' These data reflect 38 nutrients measured in 5105 subjects participating in the NHANES study
#' (2011-2012, 2013-2014, 2015-2016 cycles). Nutrients were estimated from the dietary intake
#' data that considered the types and amounts of foods and beverages consumed during the 24-hour
#' period prior to the interview. Two interviews were performed: the first one was collected
#' in-person while the second interview was collected by telephone 3 to 10 days later. In this
#' study we averaged the two nutrients when both evaluations were considered as usual food
#' consumption (only one measurement was included in the analysis if the other one was not usual
#' while the observation was dropped if both evaluations were not usual) and we added the dietary
#' supplement intake when applicable.
#' Additionally, BMI as both a continuous variable (`bmxbmi`) and categorical variable (`bmi_cat`)
#' was included as outcome variable.
#' A total of 10 covariates can also be found inn the dataset
